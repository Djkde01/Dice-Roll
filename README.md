Hello! This is the repository of the Technical Assestment for the selection process of BeKind, a company that help companies deliver better and more resilient products.

  - [BeKind Website](https://bekind.software/)

# About the test

The test consist in build a Web App that allows the user to throw dices

  - Users must be able to perform the action of throwing dice
  - A dice must not land twice consecutively in the same value but maintain randomness on the rest of the faces

Additionally, there are some extras such as:

  - Be able to choose the number of faces of the dice
  - Being able to roll multiple dice at the same time
  - Being able to roll multiple dice of different faces at the same time
  - Being able to enter multiple users and take turns to roll the dice as well as a count of them

### Live Demo

You can see the project running in a Prod enviroment [here](https://djkde-dices.netlify.app/)

### Tech

In this project, various tools and technologies were used, the purposes of which will be explained below:

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
* [React.js](reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building the user interfaces
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - A static module bundler for the application


### Installation

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Clone this repo in your local terminal.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Djkde01/Dice-Roll.git
```

Go to the root folder of the project and install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the application.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

If everything gone well, the app should be running in the port https://localhost/8080


### Development

The application was a huge and very interesting challenge, that allows the imagination to fly with the number of solutions you can have.

It took almost 6 hours to develop the result that you can see in the `main` branch [accord to WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@5f919ea9-8377-4663-abc4-0c1d3a8fd709/projects/sfmdyfjomb?start=2021-05-02&end=2021-05-08), and it meets the minimum requirements, as well as a couple of extras.

However, I want to continue developing the remaining extras, so I'll keep uploading commits (On a branch other than main, of course)
### Todos

 - Implement turn change by clicking the button.
 - Improve componentization of Main Menu form
